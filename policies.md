Below are some policies a Lion Warden must abide by.

## Scalp Turn-In

   *  All cross race scalps go to Captain-General Gareth Bryne, of which you will
      recieve quest points depending on the type of scalp given (2, 3, 5).
   *  All same side scalps from Andoran wanteds go to Captain-General Gareth 
      Bryne. After submitting the scalp, type time. Log both these things and 
      send to __scalpawards__ via forum mail.
   *  You cannot hand in any scalps of people who submitted themselves to be 
      pardoned.

## Clan Chest

   *  You will need to note down any withdraws in the chest thread.
   *  Items withdrawn are for Lion Warden use only.
   *  You cannot take from the chest to re-equip alts.
   *  Do not drop anything in this room or it gets eaten by mobol.

## Barracks

   *  Do not spam in and out of barracks. Doing so will trigger mobol that will
      knock you out and send you to the cells with a warrant. This prevents
      thieves from walking in, taking things, then running out.

## Minimum Time Length Before Pardon Quest

   *  _Note: You must post in the Warrant/Pardon thread whenever a warrant is
      issued or a pardon is granted._
   *  _Note: These only apply to times before pardon quests can be granted. If a
      warrant is appealed, the appeal process trumps this and is to be given
      immediate priority._
   *  Murder: 1 month
   *  Theft, Attacking: 1 week (banishment or warrant, up to Lion Warden on duty)
   *  Physical attacks on a Lion Warden: 2 weeks

## Dockable Offenses

   *  Taking items from the chest and not posting it within 24 hours (2qps, 
      repeat offenses will be higher)
   *  Not wearing clan cloak at all times
   *  Insulting higher ranking members (you can disagree without insulting)
   *  Officers (Rank 5+) must be wearing at least one pair of golden braids as
      expected of their rank

## Incognito

   *  If you plan on being incognito, you must have Lion Warden in your title.

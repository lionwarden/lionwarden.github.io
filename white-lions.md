After rescuing a pair of white lion cubs, formerly thought to be extinct, they
now have a home in the palace. For now, they are staying with the Queen and the
Captain-General in the Queen's Private Conference Room.

There is a male and a female cub. The male has been named Paxle, after the late 
Lion Warden whose portrait has been placed in the entrance to the Throne Room.
The female is named Ishara after Ishara Casalain, the first Queen of Andor.

*  `here ishara`  
   Call Ishara to your side so she can play with you and follow you around.

*  `stay here`  
   Order the cubs to stay put.

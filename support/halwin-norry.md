*  `state of emergency`  
   The Emergency Act of 513 was enacted when there were multiple problems in Andor.
   Andor was getting multiple raids on a daily basis from many different sides, and
   people would just mill around, sit at gates, and get in the way without actually
   doing anything. So the solution was that in an attack situation, it called up
   every QG, militia, and wannabe to fight as a mandatory item (ie, if we catch you
   just sitting there and not defending the nation, you're in big trouble). It also
   required that everyone else either go to CCS and -stay there- otherwise they were
   expected to group up under the direction of a QG and fight. It was regardless of
   clan affiliation -- if you're in Andor and the Act is called, you either help
   fight, you leave, or you sit down and shut up.

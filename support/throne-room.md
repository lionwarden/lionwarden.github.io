The Throne Room is heavily guarded, and if attacked, Prince Gawyn will close
and lock the door.

*  `say stand down`  
   Prince Gawyn will unlock the greatdoor.

If the Throne Room is under attack and Prince Gawyn has locked the door, there
is an alternate way into the Throne Room for Lion Wardens.

*  `push boar`  
   Do this from the bedroom of Prince Gawyn to get into Queen Morgase's Private
   Conference Room east of the Throne Room.
